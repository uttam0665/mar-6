    "For example, let's consider two variables - age and income. Age is an example of a ratio level variable because it has a true zero point (birth), whereas income is an example of an interval level variable because it has no true zero point.\n",
    "If we were to analyze these two variables together without considering their level of measurement, we might be tempted to apply the same statistical tests to both variables. \n",
    "However, this would be inappropriate because the types of statistical tests that can be used with age (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation, correlation, regression) are different from those that can be used with income (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation, t-tests, ANOVA).    "

    "2.Median: The median is the middle value in a dataset when the values are arranged in order from smallest to largest. \n",
    "          The median is less sensitive to outliers than the mean and is a more robust measure of central tendency.  \n",
    "          It is used to provide a representative value for datasets that have extreme values or are skewed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Mode: The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a dataset. \n",
    "        The mode is used to describe the most common value or category in a dataset. \n",
    "        It is particularly useful for categorical data or discrete data.\n",

    "4.Range: The range is the difference between the largest and smallest values in a dataset.\n",
    "         It provides an indication of the spread of the dataset. However, it is sensitive to outliers and may not be a reliable measure of variability for datasets with extreme values.\n",

    "                      It provides a measure of how much the values in a dataset vary from the mean. It is used to describe the variability of a dataset and is particularly useful for datasets that are normally distributed.\n",

    "6.Variance: The variance is a measure of the spread of the dataset, which is calculated by squaring the standard deviation.\n",
